# Congressmen-Stock-Trades-Webscrapping-script
Python Webscrapping script using Selenium, BeautifulSoup4 and Pandas to extract and organize Stock Trades made by members of Congress

Essentially,  the script webscraps the website, Capitoltrades.com, using Selenium to select and click buttons.  Beautifulsoup4 is used to locate the data from the website and Pandas to organize the data into a exportable table.
This script was an experiment and learning opportunity for me to drive into automation and extract data that I thought was interested and usually behind a paywall.
I do want to continue to work on the script and optimize it further.
